Track Frequency Response Evaluation
========================================

This example evaluates the frequency response of a track composed of TIM4 or TIM4eb (eb: elastic bedding) elements using the `github example code <https://github.com/CyprienHoelzl/railFE/blob/main/examples/TrackFrequencyResponseEvaluation.py>`_.

Frequency response of the track for point excitation at mid-span or over the sleeper for changing ballast pameters:

   :target: Frequency response for changing ballast parameters

Frequency response of the track for point excitation at mid-span or over the sleeper for changing pad pameters:

   :target: Frequency response for changing pad parameters

Frequency response observed at different DOFs of the track for point excitation at mid-span or over the sleeper compared for PT (TIM4) and EB (TIM4eb):
